abstract="We discuss the use of elliptic curves in cryptography. In particular, we propose an analogue of the Diffie-Hellmann key exchange protocol which appears to be immune from attacks of the style of Western, Miller, and Adleman. With the current bounds for infeasible attack, it appears to be about 20{\%} faster than the Diffie-Hellmann scheme over GF(p). As computational power grows, this disparity should get rapidly bigger.",
