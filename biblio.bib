abstract="We discuss the use of elliptic curves in cryptography. In particular, we propose an analogue of the Diffie-Hellmann key exchange protocol which appears to be immune from attacks of the style of Western, Miller, and Adleman. With the current bounds for infeasible attack, it appears to be about 20{\%} faster than the Diffie-Hellmann scheme over GF(p). As computational power grows, this disparity should get rapidly bigger.",

abstract="We introduce a short signature scheme based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption on certain elliptic and hyper-elliptic curves. The signature length is half the size of a DSA signature for a similar level of security. Our short signature scheme is designed for systems where signatures are typed in by a human or signatures are sent over a low-bandwidth channel.",
